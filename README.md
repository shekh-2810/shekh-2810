# Hi, I'm Shekh

### Security Researcher • Recon Engineering • Developer Mindset

I study how the web works, break it to understand the gaps, and build tools to make the process efficient.  
My approach mixes security research with practical development so every project improves both my skills and workflow.

---

### What I Work On
- Web application security + bug hunting  
- Recon pipelines on Linux/Kali  
- Automation using Bash, Python, and open-source tooling  
- Building small utilities for testing and analysis  
- Understanding real-world web logic, architectures, and common failure patterns  

---

### Current Focus
Working on projects like **DocInferX**, **AstraLock**, and something called **DNStrix**.  
Only two are public.  
The last one—people can decide for themselves if it will ever appear.

<!--
Hidden note: DNStrix is still under wraps. Let them guess if it’s coming or not.

### More About Me
I like building from scratch, experimenting with ideas, and refining systems until they work cleanly.  
I mix exploration, development, and security research to create tools and workflows that actually solve problems.

Feel free to check out my projects, experiments, and ongoing work.
